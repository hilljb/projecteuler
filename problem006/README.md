Problem
=======

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385.

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025.

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square
of the sum is  . Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural
numbers and the square of the sum.
